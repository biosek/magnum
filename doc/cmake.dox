/** @page cmake Usage with CMake
@brief Guide how to find and use %Magnum with CMake build system

%Magnum uses CMake build system for both building and integration into your
projects. The logic is in module `FindMagnum.cmake` distributed with the engine
in `modules/` directory, you are encouraged to copy it (and its dependencies)
into your project and add path to the files to `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. Otherwise,
if CMake won't be able to find this file in predefined locations, it will error
out even if %Magnum might be installed on the system.

Basic usage is:

    find_package(Magnum REQUIRED)

This command tries to find base %Magnum library and then defines these
variables:

-   `MAGNUM_FOUND` -- Whether the library was found
-   `MAGNUM_LIBRARIES` -- %Magnum library and dependent libraries
-   `MAGNUM_INCLUDE_DIRS` -- Root include dir and include dirs of dependencies
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_DIR` -- Base directory with plugins. You can modify it
    (e.g. set it to `.` when deploying on Windows with plugins stored
    relatively to the executable), the following `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_*_DIR`
    variables depend on it.
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_INCLUDE_DIR` -- Include dir with plugins
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_FONT_DIR` -- Directory with font plugins
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_FONTCONVERTER_DIR` -- Directory with font converter plugins
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_IMAGECONVERTER_DIR` -- Directory with image converter
    plugins
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_IMPORTER_DIR` -- Directory with importer plugins
-   `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_AUDIOIMPORTER_DIR` -- Directory with audio importer plugins

However, this command will try to find only the base library, not the optional
components. The base library depends on %Corrade and OpenGL libraries (or
OpenGL ES libraries). Additional dependencies are specified by the components.
The optional components are:

-   `%Audio` -- Audio library
-   `%DebugTools` -- DebugTools library (depends on `%MeshTools`,
    `%Primitives`, `%SceneGraph`, `%Shaders` and `%Shapes` components)
-   `%MeshTools` -- MeshTools library
-   `%Primitives` -- Primitives library
-   `%SceneGraph` -- SceneGraph library
-   `%Shaders` -- Shaders library
-   `%Shapes` -- Shapes library (depends on `%SceneGraph` component)
-   `%Text` -- Text library (depends on `%TextureTools` component)
-   `%TextureTools` -- TextureTools library

Platform namespace is split into more components:

-   `%GlutApplication` -- @ref Platform::GlutApplication "GlutApplication"
-   `%GlxApplication` -- @ref Platform::GlxApplication "GlxApplication"
-   `%NaClApplication` -- @ref Platform::NaClApplication "NaClApplication"
-   `%Sdl2Application` -- @ref Platform::Sdl2Application "Sdl2Application"
-   `%XEglApplication` -- @ref Platform::XEglApplication "XEglApplication"
-   `%WindowlessGlxApplication` -- @ref Platform::WindowlessGlxApplication "WindowlessGlxApplication"
-   `%WindowlessNaClApplication` -- @ref Platform::WindowlessNaClApplication "WindowlessNaClApplication"

The library also contains a set of plugins for importing essential file
formats. Additional plugins are provided in separate plugin repository, see
@ref cmake-plugins for more information. If you are going to use dynamic
plugins (the default) via plugin manager, they don't need to be handled via
CMake. The manager will look for them at runtime at specified location and
loads them dynamically. However, if they are built as static (see
@ref building-plugins for more information), they need to be linked into the
executable and then explicitly imported. Also if you are going to use them as
dependencies, you need to find the dependency and then link to it.

-   `MagnumFont` -- @ref Text::MagnumFont "MagnumFont" plugin (depends on
    `%Text` component and `TgaImporter` plugin)
-   `MagnumFontConverter` -- @ref Text::MagnumFontConverter "MagnumFontConverter"
    plugin (depends on `%Text` component and `%TgaImageConverter` plugin)
-   `TgaImageConverter` -- @ref Trade::TgaImageConverter "TgaImageConverter"
    plugin
-   `TgaImporter` -- @ref Trade::TgaImporter "TgaImporter" plugin
-   `WavAudioImporter` -- @ref Audio::WavImporter "WavAudioImporter" plugin
    (depends on `%Audio` component)

Note that [each namespace](namespaces.html), all @ref Platform libraries and
each plugin class contain more detailed information about dependencies,
availability on particular platform and also guide how to enable given library
in build and use it with CMake.

Example usage with specifying additional components is:

    find_package(Magnum REQUIRED MeshTools Primitives GlutApplication)

For each component is then defined:

-   `MAGNUM_*_FOUND` -- Whether the component was found
-   `MAGNUM_*_LIBRARIES` -- Component library and dependent libraries
-   `MAGNUM_*_INCLUDE_DIRS` -- Include dirs of module dependencies

If exactly one `*Application` or exactly one `Windowless*Application` component
is requested and found, its libraries and include dirs are available in
convenience aliases `MAGNUM_APPLICATION_LIBRARIES` /
`MAGNUM_WINDOWLESSAPPLICATION_LIBRARIES` and `MAGNUM_APPLICATION_INCLUDE_DIRS`
/ `MAGNUM_WINDOWLESSAPPLICATION_INCLUDE_DIRS` to simplify porting.

Features of found %Magnum library are exposed in these CMake variables, they
are also available as preprocessor variables if including Magnum.h:

-   `MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED` -- Defined if compiled with deprecated APIs
    included
-   `MAGNUM_BUILD_STATIC` -- Defined if built as static libraries. Default are
    shared libraries.
-   `MAGNUM_TARGET_GLES` -- Defined if compiled for OpenGL ES
-   `MAGNUM_TARGET_GLES2` -- Defined if compiled for OpenGL ES 2.0
-   `MAGNUM_TARGET_GLES3` -- Defined if compiled for OpenGL ES 3.0
-   `MAGNUM_TARGET_DESKTOP_GLES` -- Defined if compiled with OpenGL ES
    emulation on desktop OpenGL

%Corrade library provides also its own set of CMake macros and variables, see
@ref corrade-cmake "its documentation" for more information.
@ref cmake-plugins "Plugins repository" and @ref cmake-integration "Integration library"
have also their own CMake modules.
