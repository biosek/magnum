/**
@brief %Timeline

Keeps track of time delta between frames and allows FPS limiting. Can be used
as source for animation speed computations.

@section Timeline-usage Basic usage

Construct the timeline on initialization so the instance is available for
whole lifetime of the application. Call start() before first draw event is
performed, after everything is properly initialized.

@note When timeline is started, it immediately starts measuring frame time.
    Be prepared that time of first frame will be much longer than time of
    following frames. It mainly depends on where you called start() in your
    initialization routine, but can be also affected by driver- and
    GPU-specific lazy texture binding, shader recompilations etc.

In your draw event implementation don't forget to call nextFrame() after
buffer swap. You can use previousFrameDuration() to compute animation speed.

Example usage:
@code
MyApplication::MyApplication(const Parameters& parameters): Platform::Application(parameters) {
    // Initialization ...

    timeline.setMinimalFrameTime(1/120.0f)  // 120 FPS at max
        .start();
}

void MyApplication::drawEvent() {
    // Distance of object travelling at speed of 15 units per second
    Float distance = 15.0f*timeline.previousFrameDuration();

    // Move object, draw ...

    swapBuffers();
    redraw();
    timeline.nextFrame();
}
@endcode
@todo FPS should be governed by Application (imagine more than one simultaenous
    timeline and the harm it could do, also vsync etc. can't be handled in
    platform-independent way here)
